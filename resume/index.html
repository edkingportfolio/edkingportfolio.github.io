                            I am a motivated, well-rounded, patient individual who never stops learning. Currently student teaching and completing a master's in education at Colorado State University.  In undergrad, I earned a bachelor’s in English and a minor in Electrical Engineering. Outside the classroom, I worked on a student satellite and a project in Peru that worked to bring education equity to rural populations. Since then, I have worked as an English as a Foreign Language teacher in China and Spain, and as a substitute teacher and tutor in Fort Collins. Throughout, I have continued to build my core skills as a teacher.
